  "Beith": "Beith, or Beth, corresponds to the letter B in the alphabet, and is associated with the Birch tree. When this symbol is used, it is representative of new beginnings, change, release, and rebirth. In some traditions, it also has connections with purification.",
  "Luis": "Luis corresponds to the letter L in the alphabet, and is associated with the Rowan tree. This symbol represents insight, protection and blessings.",
  "Fearn": "F is for Fearn or Fern, which is associated with the Alder tree. The Alder is representative of the evolving spirit. Connected with the month of March and the spring equinox, Alder is the symbol of Bran in Celtic mythology. In The Mabinogion, Bran laid himself across a river as a bridge so that others might cross–likewise, the Alder bridges that magical space between earth and the heavens. It is also associated with oracular powers–Bran's head was an oracle in legend.",
  "Saille": "S is for Saille, pronounced sahl-yeh, and is associated with the Willow tree. The Willow is often found near water, and when nourished it will grow rapidly. This symbol is representative of knowledge and spiritual growth, as well as being connected with the month of April. Willows offer protection and healing, and is closely connected to the cycles of the moon. Likewise, this symbol is tied to women's mysteries and cycles.",
  "Nion": "N is for Nion, sometimes called Nuin, which is connected to the Ash tree. Ash is one of three trees which were sacred to the Druids (Ash, Oak and Thorn), and connects the inner self to the outer worlds. This is a symbol of connections and creativity, and transitions between the worlds.",
  "Huath": "H is for Huath, or Uatha, and is symbolic of the Hawthorn tree. This prickly-thorned tree is associated with cleansing, protection and defense. Tie a thorn with a red ribbon and use it as a protective amulet in your home, or place a bundle of thorns under a baby's crib to keep bad energy away. Because the Hawthorn typically blooms around Beltane, it is also strongly connected with fertility, masculine energy, and fire.",
  "Duir": "D is for Duir, the Celtic tree of Oak. Like the mighty tree it represents, Duir is associated with strength, resilience and self-confidence. The Oak is strong and powerful, often dominating over its shorter neighbors. The Oak King rules over the summer months, and this tree was sacred to the Druids. Some scholars say the word Duir translates to \"door,\" the root word of \"Druid\". The Oak is connected with spells for protection and strength, fertility, money and success, and good fortune.",
  "Tinne": "T stands for Tinne, or Teine, the Holly tree. This evergreen plant is connected to immortality, unity, courage, and the stability of hearth and home. Pronounced chihnn-uh by the Celts, the wood of the Holly was often used in the construction of weapons, and is known as a plant of warriors and protectors.",
  "Coll": "C, sometimes read as K, is Coll, which is the Hazel tree. August is known as the Hazel Moon, because this is when Hazel nuts appear on the trees–the world Coll translates to \"the life force inside you\", and what better symbol of life than the nut itself? Hazel is associated with wisdom and creativity and knowledge. Sometimes it is connected in Celtic lore with magical springs, sacred wells, and divination.",
  "Quert": "Q is for Quert, sometime spelled Ceirt, and is tied to the luscious Apple tree. Long symbolic of love and faithfulness, as well as rebirth, the Apple is often associated with magic. If you cut an apple in half sideways, the seeds form one of nature's perfect stars. In addition to love, the appearance of Quert reminds us of the eternal cycle of life. After all, once the Apple tree dies, its fruit returns to the ground to birth new trees for coming harvests.",
  "Muin": "M is Muin, the Vine, that magnificent plant which produces grapes... the source of wine. We all know that once we're under its influence, wine sometimes makes us say things we otherwise would never consider. In fact, the words of one who has been consuming it are often uninhibited. The Vine is connected to prophecy and truthful speaking–because typically, people who have been partaking of its gifts are incapable of being deceptive and dishonest. Muin is a symbol of inward journeys and life lessons learned.",
  "Gort": "G is Gort, the Ivy that sometimes grows freely, but often parasites upon other plants. It will grow in nearly any condition, and its endless upward spiral is representative of our soul's search for self, as we wander between this world and the next. Gort, pronounced go-ert, is connected to growth and wildness, as well as confronting the mystical aspects of our own development and evolution. Also connected to the month of October and the Samhain sabbat, Ivy often lives on after its host plant has died–a reminder to us that life goes on, in the endless cycle of life, death and rebirth.",
  "nGeatal": "Ng, or nGeatal, is the Reed that grows straight and tall at the riverside. Long ago, it was considered the perfect wood for arrows because it was so perfectly formed. Symbolic of music and flutes, the Reed indicates direct action, and finding purpose in your journey. It is connected with health and healing, and with gatherings of family and friends.",
  "Straith": "This symbol, used for the sound St, is Straith (sometimes seen as Straif), the Blackthorn tree. A symbol of authority and control, the Blackthorn is connected to strength and triumph over adversity. Blackthorn is a tree (although some might argue it's more of a really big shrub) of winter, and its berries only ripen after the first frost. White flowers appear in the spring, and the bark is black and thorny.",
  "Ruis": "R is Ruis, the Elder tree, which is connected to the time of the Winter Solstice. The Elder represents endings, maturity, and the awareness that comes with experience. Pronounced roo-esh, Ruis is a sign that things may be ending, but will yet begin again some day. Although the Elder is easily damaged, it recovers and is rejuvenated easily.",
  "Ailim": "A is for Ailim, or Ailm, the Elm tree. Interestingly, this group also includes the Pine or Fir trees. These giants of the forest are symbols of perspective and height, rising above those that surround us. The Elm has a clear vision of that which surrounds it, as well as that which is approaching.",
  "Onn": "O is Onn, or Ohn, and represents the Gorse bush, sometimes called Furze. This yellow, flowery shrub grows on moors all year long, and is full of nectar and pollen. It's a food source for many animals–the stalks are munched on by grazing livestock–but eventually Furze is set on fire. This controlled burn allows old deadwood to be gotten rid of, and clears the way for new life to begin. Gorse (Furze) represents long-term thinking and planning–knowing that sometimes we have to do without in order to gain things in the future. Gorse is a determined sort of plant that always comes back, and so it is also connected with perseverance and hope.",
  "Uhr": "U (sometimes W) is Uhr or Ura, the Heather plant, which symbolizes passion and generosity. This ground-covering plant grows on top of peat in the moors of the Celtic lands. The blossoms are full of rich nectar and are very attractive to bees, which are seen in some traditions as messengers to and from the spirit world. Uhr is associated with both generosity and healing, as well as contact with the Otherworld.",
  "Eadhadh": "E is Eadhadh, or Eadha, which is the Aspen, a symbol of endurance and courage. The Aspen is a durable, hardy tree that grows all over North America and Scotland, so when Eadhadh appears, take it as a sign of strong will and success. Challenges may come your way, but you will eventually conquer your adversaries and obstacles.",
  "Iodhadh": "I is Iodhadh, or Idad, the Yew tree. Much like the Death card in the Tarot, the Yew is known as a marker of death and endings. This evergreen tree has leaves that are attached in a spiral pattern to the twigs. Because of its unusual growth pattern, in which new growth forms inside the old, the Yew is strongly tied to rebirth and new life following death.",
  "Eabhadh": "The Eabhadh symbol, which represents the sound Ea, is connected to trees which are found in groves–Aspen, Birch, etc.–the sacred places where Druids once gathered. When Eabhadh appears, it's often a clue that there is some sort of conflict resolution, justice, or counsel about to occur. In some traditions, this symbol is associated with attracting the harmonies of life through spiritual growth.",
  "Oir": "Oi, sometimes representing the Th sound, is Oir, the Spindle tree, which was used to make bobbins and pegs, as well as (obviously) spindles. This dainty little tree is misleading–while it looks delicate, it's also very strong. The durability and strength of the wood made it useful for oxen-goads, which were used in ploughing. The white flowers and bright red autumn fruits, connect the Spindle tree to the hearth and home, as well as the bonds of kinfolk and clan.",
  "Uillean": "Ui (sometimes interpreted as Pe) is Uillean, the Honeysuckle. Associated with the manifestation of will, the Honeysuckle starts as a small seed and creeps along, growing and spreading over time. Honeysuckle twists and spirals up and over its surroundings, its soft yellow flowers releasing a sweet scent. It is the flower of unspoken desire, hidden needs, secret wants, but it also represents our goals of finding our true Self.",
  "Ifin": "o (sometimes Ph) is Ifin or Iphin, the Pine tree. This evergreen was once known as the \"sweetest of wood,\" and its needles can be brewed into tea which provides a good source of Vitamin C. Pine is associated with clarity of vision, and alleviation of guilt. When Ifin appears, it may indicate feelings of guilt that need to be put aside, or unresolved conflicts that need closure.",
  "Amhancholl": "Ae (sometimes represented as X or Xi), is Amhancholl or Eamhancholl, associated with Witch Hazel. This natural astringent is purifying and cleansing. The word Eamhancholl literally translates to \"twin of Hazel\", so there is a strong connection to C–Coll in the Ogham. When Amhancholl appears, it's usually an indicator that cleansing and purification is necessary or has taken place."
